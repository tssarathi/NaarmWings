# Bird Watch Visualization App

## About This Project

This is our **Assignment 3** for **Information Visualisation (GEOM90007)** at the University of Melbourne. We built an interactive app that shows bird sightings around Melbourne using R Shiny and Tableau.

The app lets users explore where different bird species have been spotted in Melbourne, when they were seen, and how bird diversity varies across the city. We used real data from BirdLife Australia to make this visualization.

## Data We Used

We got our bird sighting data from **BirdLife Australia's Birdata** database through the **Atlas of Living Australia**. The dataset has over 32,000 bird observation records within the **City of Melbourne (LGA: Melbourne)**.

We gratefully acknowledge **BirdLife Australia** and the **Atlas of Living Australia** for making these data openly available.  
This dataset has been used solely for **educational and research purposes** as part of the Bird Watch Visualization App project.
