## About This Project

This is our **Assignment 3** for **Information Visualisation (GEOM90007)** at the University of Melbourne. We built an interactive app that shows bird sightings around Melbourne using R Shiny and Tableau.

The app lets users explore where different bird species have been spotted in Melbourne, when they were seen, and how bird diversity varies across the city. We used real data from BirdLife Australia to make this visualization.

## Data We Used

We got our bird sighting data from **BirdLife Australia's Birdata** database through the **Atlas of Living Australia**. The dataset has over 32,000 bird observation records within the **City of Melbourne (LGA: Melbourne)**.

We gratefully acknowledge **BirdLife Australia** and the **Atlas of Living Australia** for making these data openly available for educational purposes.

### Third-Party Libraries

This project uses the **tableau-in-shiny** R library (version 1.2, 2024-09-04) written by **Alan Thomas** from the University of Melbourne. This library is provided as part of the GEOM90007 Information Visualisation course materials and enables seamless embedding of Tableau Public visualizations in Shiny applications using the Tableau Embedding API v3.

- **File**: `R/tableau-in-shiny-v1.2.R`  
- **Author**: Alan Thomas, University of Melbourne  
- **Copyright**: 2023–2024 The University of Melbourne  
- **License**: MIT License  

We gratefully acknowledge the provision of this library code for educational purposes in the GEOM90007 course.

### 🧭 How to Run the App

> ⚠️ **Note:** This app uses CSS styles that are not supported by the built-in RStudio viewer.  
> For the best experience, open the app in an **external browser**.

### Install dependencies

```r
source("./R/libraries.R")

Running the Shiny App

At the root project directory:

shiny::runApp()

Running the Shiny App silently

shiny::runApp(launch.browser = FALSE)
```

---

### 🏗️ Building

Directory Tree

```
root
├── Data: data sources for the dashboard
├── R: supporting R scripts for the app
├── src: supporting non-R source files and assets
└── www: production non-R files and assets for use by the app
```

Building supporting (non-R) source files (optional)

Non-R source files are built using webpack, transforming from ./src to ./www.

#### install node modules
```
npm install
```

#### build
```
npm run build
```

---

### Limitations & Future Work
  -	Audio data was not available for 8 bird species, resulting in missing playback functionality for those entries.
  -	The morphological dataset (AVONET) has been prepared but not yet integrated into the current interface.
Future versions will incorporate this dataset to enhance the visual and analytical components of the application.
